## Research Interest


### Microecological Analysis and Intervention


Analysis and intervention of gut microecology in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome based on phage-bacteria-human host interaction (supported by the National Science Foundation of China, No. 32270677).





### Bioinformaitcs tool development

The research group has developed a variety of widely recognized bioinformatics tools in the fields of biomedical knowledge mining and knowledge discovery (e.g., clusterProfiler), phylogenetic data integration and visualization (e.g., treeio and ggtree), metagenomic data analysis (e.g., MicrobiotaProcess) and data visualization (e.g., ggbreak), etc., to help biologists explore and understand data.
